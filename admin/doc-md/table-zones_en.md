Here you bring everything together by defining all "zones" (e.g. bathroom 1st floor, coffee corner, etc.) and assigning triggers and target devices to be switched, as well as defining further conditions for execution.

| Column | Mandatory | Description |
|----------|:------------:|-------|
| ![image](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smartcontrol/blob/master/admin/doc-md/img/check_box-24px.svg?raw=true) |  Yes   | Enables/disables this table row. If not activated, this table row is ignored by the adapter. In the Adapter Options, under 'FURTHER OPTIONS > Input Validation', you can set that even disabled rows are checked for validity. |
| Name of zone | Yes | Any zone name. |
| Trigger | Yes | Select one or more triggers to assign to this zone. If you enter more than one motion sensors here, the zone will only be switched off again if none of these motion sensors has registered any more motion.|
| Target devices | Yes | Here you select one or more target devices to be switched, which will be switched as soon as a trigger is triggered and the conditions are met.<br><br>With the blue button to the left you can select much faster in case of many target devices. A dialog opens where you can find, filter and select the target devices more easily.<br><br>**Function 'Set individual options für target device'**:<br>In the dialog that appears when you click on the blue button to the left, you can set individual values for target devices by double clicking or 'F2', example: **{**`val:Radio Chillout, delay:20`**}**.<br>`val` overwrites the *Value for 'on'* of *1. TARGET DEVICES*.<br>`delay` the target device is switched on delayed by this number of seconds when the zone is activated.<br><br>Your entered options will appear in curly brackets after the name.<br>![image](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smartcontrol/blob/master/admin/doc-md/img/table-zones_select-target-devices-overwrite.gif?raw=true)<br><br>**Tip**: Use dots as separators in tab "1. TARGET DEVICES" for the target device names and organize them e.g. by rooms and devices, e.g. "Bathroom.Lights.Ceiling", "Bathroom.Lights.Wall left", etc. The target devices will then be displayed here as folders: "Bathroom > Lights > Ceiling", etc. |
| ![image](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smartcontrol/blob/master/admin/doc-md/img/timelapse-24px.svg?raw=true)|  Nein   | **Delay for switching zone on (in seconds)** This allows you to set a delay: after this number of seconds the zone will actually be switched on.<br>Leave empty or set `0` to ignore this option. |
| ![image](https://github.com/iobroker-community-adapters/ioBroker.smartcontrol/blob/master/admin/doc-md/img/timer-24px.svg?raw=true) | No | **Switch zone off after x seconds**: This switches the zone off after the specified number of seconds (independent of any motion sensors). The timer for switching off starts as soon as the zone is switched on. If the zone is switched on again in between, this timer will be restarted.<br>Leave empty or set `0` to ignore this option. |
| Never switch off if... | No | Here you can enter additional conditions, for example: No one at home, radio is on, etc. If these conditions apply, the target devices of this zone **will not** be turned off when a timer expires. This applies to both the timer *Switch zone off after x seconds* and motion sensor timers. |
| ✓✓ | No | For *Never switch off if...*: If activated, all conditions must apply ('and'). If disabled, it is enough if one of the conditions applies.<br>If you select only one condition, it doesn't matter if you enable it or not.|
| Execution | Yes | Clicking this button opens a dialog where you can define further conditions when the target devices, as defined in the zone, will be switched as soon as a trigger is triggered. Details are described in this dialog. |
| Always | Yes | This option is identical to "Execute always" in the 'Execution' dialog (see above): If activated, the adapter will always execute if any previously defined conditions apply. If not activated, you must create at least one active line in the 'Execution' dialog. |
